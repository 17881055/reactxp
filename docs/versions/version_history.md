## Version Strategy

A new version of ReactXP will be released on approximately a monthly basis, following the same general update timeline of React Native. Each new version will get its own branch, allowing consumers of the library to take a dependency on a stable code base.


## Version 1.0.0

_Released 10 Apr 2017_
This is the initial public release of the ReactXP core library. It is built against React Native 0.42.
