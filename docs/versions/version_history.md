# ReactXP Versioning

### Versioning Strategy
A new version of ReactXP will be released a monthly basis (approximately), following the same general update timeline of React Native. Each new version will get its own branch, allowing consumers of the library to take a dependency on a stable code base.



### Version 0.34.1
_Released 6 Apr 2017_

This is the initial public release of the ReactXP core library. It is built against React Native 0.34. We are working on updating it to a newer version of React Native, and this will be released shortly.
