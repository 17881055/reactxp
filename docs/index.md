      <h3>ReactXP</h3>
      <p>
        The authors of React use the phrase “learn once, write anywhere”. With React and React 
        Native, your web app can share most its logic with your iOS and Android apps, but the view 
        layer needs to be implemented separately for each platform. We have taken this a step further 
        and developed a thin cross-platform layer we call ReactXP. If you write your app to this 
        abstraction, you can share your view definitions, styles and animations across multiple target 
        platforms.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        ReactXP is designed with cross-platform development in mind. In general, it exposes
        APIs, components, props, styles and animation parameters that are implemented in
        a consistent way across React JS (HTML) and React Native for iOS and Android. A few
        platform-specific props and style attributes have been exposed, but we have tried to
        keep these to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        ReactXP is meant to be as lightweight as possible. The “core” components and APIs are
        limited to the functionality required for almost all applications. Extensions to
        ReactXP expose more specialized functionality in a similar cross-platform manner.

      <h3>Genesis</h3>
      <p>
        This library was initially developed within the Skype team, but it has since started to
        be used elsewhere within Microsoft. We now want to make it available to the broader
        React and React Native open source community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have made numerous other source contributions to React Native in an effort to minimize
        the differences between various platforms. These contributions included a major rewrite of
        the CSS Layout engine used in React Native. The new version more closely matches the W3C
        flexbox standard, so layouts are consistent across React JS (HTML) and React Native.
