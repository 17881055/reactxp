      <h3>Why React?</h3>
      <p>
        React is an open-source framework initially developed by Facebook. It is a view framework, not 
        a full app framework. It doesn't dictate a particular data model approach, nor does it provide 
        or require any other layers such as controllers or view models. React is able to accommodate 
        traditional patterns like MVC and MVVM, but it is flexible enough to accommodate others as well 
        (for example, Flux, Baobab, and Relay). This allows React to be used in a variety of apps — both 
        complex and simple.

        React is the first framework that spans web and native controls. Using a single view definition 
        language (which includes layout, style and animation information), developers can target both 
        HTML and native controls. Application logic can be written in Javascript or TypeScript.

        React provides a convenient and efficient way for developers to define component layout within 
        their code. This so-called JSX notation is written within TypeScript code and looks similar to 
        HTML in syntax. Style information can also be provided inline within a component's source file 
        using CSS-like syntax, allowing components to be entirely self-contained. Because the layout 
        information, style information and component logic are all written within a single language, 
        the complier is able to provide type checking and IntelliSense.

        Finally, there's a thriving open-source community built up around React. More companies are 
        building on it every day, and Facebook continues to make major investments in it.

        The authors of React are fond of the phrase “learn once, write anywhere”. With React and React 
        Native, your web app can share most its logic with your iOS and Android apps, but the view 
        layer needs to be implemented separately for each platform. We have taken this a step further 
        and developed a thin cross-platform layer that we call ReactX. If you write your app to this 
        abstraction, you can share your view definitions, styles and animations across various target 
        platforms.
